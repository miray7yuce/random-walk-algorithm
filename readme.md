# random-walk-algorithm
This project is a simple algorithm that simulates a drunken bug walking on a random grid.

How does it work?
- The user enters the row and column dimensions of the grid.
- The bug specifies the starting point.
- The bug moves randomly to neighboring cells.
- If all cells are visited at least once, the simulation succeeds.
- If a certain iteration limit is reached, the simulation fails.
